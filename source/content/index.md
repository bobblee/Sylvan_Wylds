## The Pitch
In the years since the verdant explosion, most of the country has been lost. Scholars suggest only about a quarter of the country was able to make it to the Capital before the majority of the country was uninhabitable. Those that have survived are trying to scrape out a life in/around the capital. Or there are those who are looking for adventure and a legacy. Venturing into the Sylvan Wylds to carve out a town and a better life for the future.

## Overview

### Pre Verdant Explosion
The Kingdom of Amorya was once a thriving continent of lush forests and thriving towns. A place that harnessed the magic of the forest to make life easier for all. From flying carriages to wands everyone can use.

### Post Verdant Explosion
The kingdom has fallen. The last bastion left from before the Verdant Explosion is capital city, Zyphear. Somehow the capital city was able to fight off the encroaching forest. Now all that remains are a handful of once removed townships from Zyphear. Â Stone roads seem to be the only reliable way to get from place to place. Because they are so difficult to build long distances, groups are sent out to find lost settlements. Once a settlement is found and held secure, a road from he Capital is started.
