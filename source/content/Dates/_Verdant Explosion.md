No one is quite sure what happened as no one in the capital city survived. The entire area around it turned to sandglass. To the east it appeared to let trees stand, but everything died. 

Whatever happened appears to have primarily affected the north, where a mountain range grew up in an instant. Areas that were once towns, cities, and farmland instantly became overrun with vegetation. The further north you got the further from "normal" the land gets.

While no one knows the reason, this is referred to as the first attack by the Fae. A group of forest creatures with an uncanny link to magic. A group that was jealous of the civilized grooming of land and technology. This wasn't the first attack on the kingdom of Amorya, but it was the last, for the once thriving Kingdom.
