After years of scavenging scraps, what was left of the royal family created a new capital of what is left of Amorya, New Zyphear. ||| The majority of the royal family was wiped out in the Verdant Explosion. What few Royals left were assassinated by the leadings in Magitech. ||| The Royal family, in embarrassment for their actions, chose to step back. They relinquished control to the scholars who created a Technocracy. A form of government based on knowledge experts ruling. In this case, a Congress of Knowledge experts in various fields.
